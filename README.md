This project was built to showcase my (awesome) React skills.

## Project goals:
- A home page that lists surfing videos
    - Infinite scrolling (react-infinite-scroller)
- Videos open in a new page to play (react-router + react-youtube)
- Search different videos within surfing category
- Video component displaying thumbnails/titles/descriptions of videos
- Bootstrap styled (react-bootstrap + react-fontawesome)

## To run locally:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Or if you prefer yarn
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
